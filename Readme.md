# GTNH Rates

This is an addon for [GregTech: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack) modpack that changes (by default):

- **Vanilla and Natura crops yield:** 4x
- **IC2 crops yield:** 4x
- **GT ore drops:** 4x (16x for Coal)
- **GT Underground Fluid Rig yield:** 4x (does not affect the total deposit amount)
- **GT machines and Railcraft Coke/Steam Ovens:** energy/time consumption reduced by 4x
- **Forestry bees output:** 4x
- **GT tools crafting durability:** 8x
- **GT singleblock Miners energy consumption:** 1x
- **IC2 Tree Tap's Sticky Resin extraction amount:** 4x
- **GT Hammer ore prospecting overhaul:** the radius is 2 blocks, but 100% chance to scan
- **Automatically open Item Holder covers' inventories:** open and close them all at once (and disable shift+clicking), like it should be

Additionally, the addon tweaks crop growth mechanics to be more time-dependent (with a minimum growth time of 5 minutes) and less reliant on random.
All values are configurable on the fly, only recipe changes require restart.

### Compatibility:
Tested with GTNH modpack versions `2.8.1`, `2.8.0`, `2.8.0-beta-2`, `2.7.0`, `2.7.0-beta-4`.
The mod .jars are not inter compatible between GTNH versions, look at the version suffix in .jar filename.

### Installation:
1. Navigate to [Releases](https://github.com/Sladki/GTNHRates/releases) page and download .jar file.
2. Put the downloaded file into "mods" subdirectory in the game installation folder (or use your launcher options).
