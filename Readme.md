# GTNH Rates

This is an addon for [GregTech: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack) modpack that introduces the following changes by default:

- **Vanilla and Natura crops yield:** 4x.
- **IC2 crops yield:** 4x.
- **GT ore drops:** 4x (16x for Coal).
- **GT Underground Fluid Rig yield:** 4x (does not affect the total deposit amount).
- **GT machines and Railcraft Coke/Steam Ovens:** energy/time consumption reduced by 4x.
- **Forestry bees output:** 4x.
- **GT tools crafting durability:** 8x.

Additionally, the addon tweaks crop growth mechanics to be more time-dependent (with a minimum growth time of 5 minutes) and less reliant on random.

### Compatibility:
Tested with GTNH modpack version `2.7.0-beta-4`.
