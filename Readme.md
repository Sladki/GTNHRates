# GTNH Rates

This is an addon for [GregTech: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack) modpack that changes (by default):

- **Vanilla and Natura crops yield:** 4x
- **IC2 crops yield:** 4x
- **GT ore drops:** 4x (16x for Coal)
- **GT Underground Fluid Rig yield:** 4x (does not affect the total deposit amount)
- **GT machines and Railcraft Coke/Steam Ovens:** energy/time consumption reduced by 4x
- **Forestry bees output:** 4x
- **GT tools crafting durability:** 8x
- **GT singleblock Miners energy consumption:** 1x
- **IC2 Tree Tap's Sticky Resin extraction amount:** 4x
- **GT Hammer ore prospecting overhaul:** the radius is 2 blocks, but 100% chance to scan
- **Automatically open Item Holder covers' inventories:** open and close them all at once (and disable shift+clicking), like it should be
- **NEI bookmarks table of contents**: lists bookmark "namespaces", allowing to quickly navigate and rearrange them, ties bookmarks to searches (see preview below)
- **Extra quests**: two new quests for early Hammer and Lumberjack Axe

Additionally, the addon tweaks crop growth mechanics to be more time-dependent (with a minimum growth time of 5 minutes) and less reliant on random.
All values are configurable on the fly, only recipe changes require restart.
